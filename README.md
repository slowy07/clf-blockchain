# clf-blockchain

blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called blocks. they can contain tranaction, files or any data you like, really. but the important thing i that they're chained together using hashes.

make sure you have python ``3.6+`` installed (along with ``pip``) and you will also need flask and request library.
